## How To

Simply copy the entire thing to your local .tex directory or Overleaf (which I recommend). You may erase the figures in the ~/fig/ folder but the ~/logos/ folder is essential to attach the Northwestern logo in the footer of the Beamer template 

## What to Edit

You may want to focus on editing the main.tex, which refers to the body .tex file that you want to compile. For ease of organization, you may want to put all your relevant figures to ~/fig/ folder.

## Typeface

The serif (Source Serif Pro) and sans serif (Roboto) typefaces used in this template are designed to match Northwestern's brand guideline, as does the purple hue as used in the .sty file. I usually find it least problematic (although may be a bit laggy) to compile in Overleaf, although I did not encounter any trouble compiling the .tex file on my local machine
